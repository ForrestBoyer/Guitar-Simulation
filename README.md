# Guitar-Simulation
Coded in C++, this project simulates the sounds produced by a guitar using the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It implements a circular buffer to simulate the plucking of a guitar string and the resulting vibrations. Has support for 37 different notes on the chromatic scale ranging from 110Hz-880Hz.
